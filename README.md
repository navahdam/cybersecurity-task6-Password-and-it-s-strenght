 Tips Learned from Evaluation
- Longer passwords (12+ characters) are much harder to crack.
- Combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases strength.
- Avoid using real words, common passwords, or patterns.
- Passphrases (e.g., `Horse$Moon7LaptopTree`) can be strong and easy to remember.
- Don‚Äôt reuse passwords across sites.
- Use a "password manager" to generate and store secure passwords.
- Enable "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)" wherever possible.

 Common Password Attacks
- "Brute Force": Tries every possible combination.
- "Dictionary Attack": Tries common words and passwords.
- "Credential Stuffing": Uses stolen passwords from other sites.
- "Phishing": Tricks users into revealing their password.
- "Keylogging": Records everything typed (via malware).
- "Rainbow Table": Uses precomputed hash-password maps.
- "Shoulder Surfing": Watches you type your password.

 How Password Complexity Affects Security
- Complex passwords are harder for attackers to crack.
- Length + variety of characters = more secure.
- Simple, short, or reused passwords are easy targets.
- Complexity makes brute-force and dictionary attacks much less effective.
