The best practices for creating strong passwords are:

1. Use at least 12 characters

   - Longer passwords are harder to crack.
   - Example: `Lu@C#iF$e%r7`

2. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

   - Example: `Lu@CiF#7e8r`

3. Avoid using personal information

   - Don’t use names, birthdays, or common words like `password`, `1234`, or `admin`.

4. Use random or unusual combinations

   - Example: `Lu@C#iF$e%r7`

5. Try using a passphrase

   - Combine 3–4 random words with a symbol or number.
   - Example: `Horse$Moon7LaptopTree`

6. Don’t reuse passwords

   - Every account should have a different password.
   - If one gets leaked, others stay safe.

7. Use a password manager

   - Tools like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass can generate and remember strong passwords for you.

8. Avoid common substitutions

   - Hackers know that `P@ssw0rd!` is just a tricky version of “password”.
   - Be more creative or use random generators.

9. Update your passwords occasionally

   - Especially if you think they’ve been exposed in a data breach.

10. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

  -Even if your password is stolen, the hacker can’t log in without your second device (like your phone).
