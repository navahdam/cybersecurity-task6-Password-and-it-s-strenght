Here are the most common password attacks:
1. Brute Force Attack

   * The attacker tries **every possible combination** of characters until they find the correct password.
   * Slow but effective if the password is short or simple.

2. Dictionary Attack

   * Uses a list of "common words, phrases, and leaked passwords" to guess the correct one.
   * Fast and effective against weak or common passwords.

3. Credential Stuffing

   * Uses "stolen usernames and passwords" from one website to try logging into other websites.
   * Works because many people reuse the same password.

4. Keylogging

   * A malicious program secretly "records everything you type", including passwords.
   * Often installed through malware or suspicious downloads.

5. Rainbow Table Attack

   * Uses a pre-computed table of "hashes and their matching passwords" to speed up cracking hashed passwords.
   * Defended against by using "salting" in password storage.

6. Shoulder Surfing

   * Someone "physically watches" you type your password (e.g., in public or at work).
   * Low-tech, but still effective.

How to Protect Yourself:

* Use "strong, unique passwords" for each account.
* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* Avoid clicking suspicious links (to prevent phishing).
* Donâ€™t download software from untrusted sources.
* Use a "password manager" to avoid reuse and generate strong passwords.
