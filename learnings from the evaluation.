After trying a lot of combination and understanding different combinations here are my learnings:
1.Longer passwords are stronger

   * Passwords with 12 or more characters are much harder to crack.

2. Mix of character types increases strength

   * Using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes a password more secure.

3.Avoid common words and patterns

   * Passwords like `password123` or `qwerty` are very weak and easily guessed.

4.Passphrases can be strong and easy to remember

   * Example: `GreenTiger!River2025` — long, unique, and meaningful.

5.Don’t reuse passwords on different sites

   * If one gets leaked, all your accounts become vulnerable.

6.Leetspeak doesn’t fool attackers

   * Passwords like `P@ssw0rd!` are still easy for hackers to guess.

7.Randomness is key

   * The more unpredictable your password, the better.

8.Password managers are helpful

   * They create and store complex passwords for every site so you don’t have to remember them all.

9.Regularly update passwords for important accounts

   * Especially after a data breach or suspicious activity.

10.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds strong extra security

* Even if someone knows your password, they can’t log in without the second factor (like a phone code).
